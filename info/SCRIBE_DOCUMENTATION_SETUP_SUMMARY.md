// Customer Module Routes
'api/v1/customers/*',

// Supplier Module Routes
'api/v1/suppliers/*',

// Sales Module Routes
'api/v1/incoming-orders/*',
'api/v1/outgoing-offers/*',
'api/v1/outgoing-shipments/*',
'api/v1/services/*',
'api/v1/return-invoices/*',

// Purchases Module Routes
'api/v1/outgoing-orders/*',
'api/v1/incoming-offers/*',
'api/v1/incoming-shipments/*',
'api/v1/expenses/*',
'api/v1/invoices/*',
'api/v1/purchase-return-invoices/*',
'api/v1/purchase-reference-invoices/*',
```

#### Updated Documentation Description:
- Changed from "Project Management and Inventory Management modules"
- To: "Project Management, Inventory Management, Customer Management, Supplier Management, Sales Management, and Purchase Management modules"

#### Updated Introduction Text:
Added comprehensive module descriptions for all 6 major modules with detailed feature lists.

### 3. Created PowerShell Documentation Scripts

Created 5 PowerShell scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

1. **`generate-customers-docs.ps1`** - Generate Customer Management documentation
2. **`generate-suppliers-docs.ps1`** - Generate Supplier Management documentation
3. **`generate-sales-docs.ps1`** - Generate Sales Management documentation
4. **`generate-purchases-docs.ps1`** - Generate Purchase Management documentation
5. **`generate-all-docs.ps1`** - Generate complete documentation for ALL modules (RECOMMENDED)

### 4. Created Comprehensive README

Created `scripts/README.md` with:
- Detailed usage instructions
- Prerequisites and troubleshooting
- Module coverage documentation
- Best practices
- Controller annotation reference

## üì¶ Generated Documentation Files

The following files are now available:

```
public/docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Interactive HTML documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ collection.json         # Postman collection
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openapi.yaml           # OpenAPI 3.0 specification
```

## üéØ Module Coverage

### Complete ERP System Documentation

The generated documentation now covers **6 major modules**:

1. **Project Management** (7 controllers)
2. **Inventory Management** (13 controllers)
3. **Customer Management** (1 controller)
4. **Supplier Management** (1 controller)
5. **Sales Management** (5 controllers)
6. **Purchase Management** (7 controllers)

**Total: 34 Controllers** with comprehensive API documentation

## üöÄ How to Use

### Generate Documentation

From the project root directory:

```powershell
# Generate complete documentation (RECOMMENDED)
.\scripts\generate-all-docs.ps1

# Or use the artisan command directly
php artisan scribe:generate --force
```

### View Documentation

1. **Option 1**: Open `public/docs/index.html` in your browser
2. **Option 2**: Run `php artisan serve` and visit `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Import to Postman

Import the Postman collection from `public/docs/collection.json` for API testing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Minor Issue Found:
- One route failed during generation: `[PUT] api/v1/manufacturing-formulas/modify-formula/{id}`
- Error: "Attempt to read property 'company_id' on null"
- This is a minor issue and doesn't affect the overall documentation generation
- The route needs authentication context during documentation generation

### Resolution:
This can be fixed by adding proper authentication mocking in the controller or by adding a `@authenticated` annotation.

## üìä Documentation Statistics

- **Total Routes Processed**: 300+ endpoints
- **Successful Routes**: 299+
- **Failed Routes**: 1 (manufacturing formula update)
- **Documentation Groups**: 20+ groups
- **Modules Covered**: 6 major modules

## üîÑ Maintenance

### When to Regenerate Documentation:

1. After adding new controllers
2. After modifying existing endpoints
3. After changing route definitions
4. After updating request validation rules
5. Before releasing new API versions

### Best Practices:

1. Always add `@group` annotations to new controllers
2. Add PHPDoc comments to all controller methods
3. Use descriptive method names and comments
4. Run `generate-all-docs.ps1` after changes
5. Review the HTML output to ensure accuracy
6. Commit generated documentation to version control

## üìù Next Steps

### Recommended Improvements:

1. **Add Response Examples**: Add `@response` annotations to controller methods
2. **Add Request Examples**: Add `@bodyParam` annotations for better documentation
3. **Fix Authentication Issue**: Resolve the manufacturing formula update route error
4. **Add API Versioning**: Consider adding version information to documentation
5. **Add Rate Limiting Info**: Document any rate limiting policies
6. **Add Error Codes**: Document standard error codes and responses

### Optional Enhancements:

1. Create separate documentation for each module
2. Add API changelog documentation
3. Create developer guides for common workflows
4. Add authentication flow diagrams
5. Create integration examples
