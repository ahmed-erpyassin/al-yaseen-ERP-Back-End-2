## üìå Notes

- The controller uses the **Sales module's** ReturnInvoiceService, Resource, and Request classes
- This is intentional for code reuse between Sales and Purchases modules
- The main difference is in the context (customers vs suppliers)
- All methods follow the same pattern as other controllers in the Purchases module
- Error handling is comprehensive with detailed messages
- All responses follow a consistent JSON structure
